# Pub Sub Event

Wrapper for Laravel events so that an event can be published externally without using a listener.

## Prerequisities


* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 5.6+
* [superbalist/laravel-pubsub](https://github.com/Superbalist/laravel-pubsub) 3.0+


### Installing

Run the below in your Laravel project to install the library:

```
    composer require entanet/pub-sub-event
```

### Registering the service provider

To register the PubSubEventProvider add the below line into the providers array in config/app.php in Laravel:

```
    'providers' => [
    ...
    \Entanet\PubSubEvent\PubSubEventServiceProvider::class
    ...
```

### Add an alias to the Pub Sub Event Facade

To add an alias to the facade add the following to the alias array in config/app.php in Laravel:

```
    'aliases' => [
    ...
    'PubSubEvent' => \Entanet\PubSubEvent\PubSubEventFacade::class,
    ...
    
```

Also you can alter the current event alias so that any current Event calls use the Pub Sub Event:

Change:

```
    'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Event' =>  Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event::class,
    ...
    
```

To:

```
    'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Event' => \Entanet\PubSubEvent\PubSubEventFacade::class,
    ...
    
```
 
 ### Overriding the Laravel global helper event
 
 Laravel comes with a global helper event which dispatches the given event. If you want to override 
 that helper with the Pub Sub Event you need to require the PubSubEventHelper.php file before the
  vendor/autoload.php. Here is an example, altering the public/index.php file in Laravel 5.6:
  
 ```
       // PubSubEventHelper.php is used to override the laravel global event helper.
        require __DIR__.'/../vendor/entanet/pub-sub-event/src/PubSubEventHelper.php';
        require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
     
 ```

### Using Pub Sub Event via the Alias/facade

Call dispatch from the facade and supply a relevant event (new \App\Events\PubEvent()), the topic ('topic_name) and the
 message to be sent ('Hello, there')   

```
    PubSubEvent::dispatch(new \App\Events\PubEvent(), 'topic_name', 'Hello, there'); 
```

Or if you have altered the existing Event alias:

```
    Event::dispatch(new \App\Events\PubEvent(), 'topic_name', 'Hello, there'); 
```

### Using Pub Sub Event via event global helper

If you overridden the global helper:

```
    Event(new \App\Events\PubEvent(), 'topic_name', 'Hello, there');
```
